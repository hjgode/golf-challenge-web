Client-side Javascript can be sent to the user along with your html.

For Example:

echo ("<HTML><HEAD>\n");
echo ("<SCRIPT TYPE=\"text/javascript\">\n");
echo ("<!--\n";
echo ("function hello() {\n");
echo ("  alert('Hi');\n");
echo ("}\n");
echo ("// -->\n");
echo ("</SCRIPT>\n");

and so on...

The client is then sent:

<HTML><HEAD>
<SCRIPT TYPE=\"text/javascript\">
<!--
function hello() {
   alear('Hi');
}
// -->
</SCRIPT>

Yes, it is possible to mix PHP and JavaScript, for example:

var givemeaphpvalue = <?php echo $phpvalue; ?>;

========================================================================================
Since PHP is server-side you can write javascript dynamically on the fly
which are then executed client-side.
Here's a simple example:

<!-- yourpage.php-->
<script language="Javascript">
var today = '<?php echo date("Y-m-d", time()); ?>';

</script>

Javascript will allow you to do dynamic stuff, but if you are looking 
for aesthetics you would be better off learning style sheets. CSS is 
much more efficient than javascript. You can actually simulate buttons, 
borders and lots of other stuff by just using CSS. And if you get good 
at CSS, you can even create themes for your website.

For instance, adding this simple code in the <HEAD> of your web page 
will cause links to change to a yellow background when the mouse is over 
the link.

<style type="text/css" media="Screen">
a:hover {background-color: yellow};
</style>
